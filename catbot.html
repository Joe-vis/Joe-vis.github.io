                <p>
                    Catbot is a bot for discord that I made with one of my friends. It is made with discord.js and node.js.<br> Catbot started as a simple meme bot that joined voice calls and played cat sounds but has now evolved into a fully working bot with many features.
                    <br>
                    Catbot is currently hosted on heroku and there is no continuation plan for it after 28th of November 2022 due to heroku closing their free dyno plan.
